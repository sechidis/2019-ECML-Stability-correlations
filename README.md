On The Stability of Feature Selection in the Presence of Prior Knowledge, K. Sechidis, S. Nogueira, K. Papangelou, J. Weatherall, and G. Brown <br/>

## Estimate Stability with Feature Redundancy
* effectiveStabilityWithRedundancy.m - Implements our stability measure that takes into account feature redundancy (Section 3.2)

## Estimate Stability with Semantically Related Features
* effectiveStabilityWithGroups.m - Implements our stability measure that takes into account groups of semantically related  features (Section 3.3)

## Tutorial
The tutorial 'Tutorial_Stability.m' presents how to estimate stability of LASSO, Elastic Net, Random Forest and CMIM using our suggested methods.
