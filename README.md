## Estimate Stability with Feature Redundancy
* effectiveStabilityWithRedundancy.m - Implements our stability measure that takes into account feature redundancy 
## Tutorial
The tutorial 'Tutorial_Stability.m' presents how to estimate stability of LASSO, Elastic Net, Random Forest and CMIM using our suggested methods.
